# Full Stack Developer

This is my collection of blogs, tutorials and courses leading to a better understanding of the modern front-end development involving JavaScript, CSS, NodeJS, its friends and related frameworks.

The intention is not to make a front-end ninja developer, but have a sound understanding of tools and development practices followed in this specialized development space, and thereby supplement my knowledge as a complete technologist.

The intent for this effort is written on my [blog](http://tech.ethomasjoseph.com/2015/10/javascript-going-universal-why-matter-you.html). Here I am trying to formalise my intent of learning front-end development tools and processes into links and *working examples* (and share it with other interested). As it can be seen in my blog, I am more interested in the JavaScript side of this world (given that I have a background of being largely a Java developer).

I am greately influenced by the Coursera's full stack [specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack), however I am skipping a few of the courses there based on my existing knowledge (and interest to the topics).

## The Learning Path

1. Overview the environment and tools - [https://dzone.com/articles/node-grunt-bower-and-yeoman](https://dzone.com/articles/node-grunt-bower-and-yeoman)
2. Webframeworks with focus on Bootstrap - [https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-frameworks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/web-frameworks)
3. Server Side development with NodeJS - [https://www.coursera.org/learn/server-side-development](https://www.coursera.org/learn/server-side-development)


I will consistently update the learning path, as and when I will find more and interesting topics to my learning objectives.
